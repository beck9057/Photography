		<h2>Photography Background</h2>
		<p>I had always been curious about photography and dabbled with it casually in the form of disposable cameras and whatever film camera I could get my hands on. I was largely limited by film and development costs.</p>
		<p>My curiosity for photography sparked to a flame in 2005 when I took Photography 101 at Ventura Community College. It was for that class that I purchased my first SLR camera, a Canon EOS 1 with the 50mm f/1.8 ("nifty fifty") lens. I learned about the light meter, what the aperture and shutter do, composition, dark room processing and print making. I found that I knew so little and wanted to learn more. A whole world of light and shadow was opening before me.</p>
		<p>While I continued to explore photography as a hobby, my journey as a professional photographer did not start until years later. As my skills began to outgrow my gear, I began upgrading my equipment and my photos started getting noticed. Eventually, I was approached by people who asked me if I could photograph their weddings. Having completed these assignments, I am confident to do more.</p>
		<p>In the past two years alone, I have taken over 17,000 photos with my DSLR camera. I took nearly 5,000 of those during a month-long trip to India, where I fell in love with the people, the land, and photography as a craft. Having now taken so many pictures, I completely agree with Henri Cartier-Bresson when he said "The first 10,000 photos are your worst."</p>
